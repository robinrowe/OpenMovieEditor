Deps:

Installation Hints for Dependencies:

ffmpeg:
 be sure to set at least the following switches at ./configure time:
 ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-shared
 Also check the messages, and make sure that all the codecs that need other
 dependencies are included, and if neccessary enable the appropriate switches
 mentioned in ./configure --help

libquicktime:
 When compiling libquicktime from source make sure that all the fancy codecs are
 enabled in the ./configure script. If some are missing, be sure to install the
 required dependency.

libsndfile:
 There is a yet to be merged variant of libsndfile that supports ogg files. Its
 at http://www.metadecks.org/software/libsndfile/ . However, I do not use it
 because ffmpeg does ogg as well.
