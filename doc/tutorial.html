<h1>Open Movie Editor Documentation</h1>

<p>Open Movie Editor is designed to be a simple tool, that provides basic movie
making capabilities. It aims to be powerful enough for the amateur movie artist,
yet easy to use.</p>

<h2>Adding video clips to the timeline</h2>

<p>The timeline is at the bottom of the application window, and features several
tracks for both, video and audio data. To add a piece of footage simple drag the
desired file from the simple file manager to the timeline. You can then position
it wherever you like. The same thing works for audio files too.</p>

<h2>Removing clips from the timeline</h2>

<p>To remove a clip, simply drag it onto the trash can on the bottom left of the
application window.</p>

<h2>Trimming clips</h2>

<p>
Trimming means setting In and Out points of a clip, defining where to start
playing the clip and where to stop the clip, think of it as removing stuff from
beginning and end of the clip. This can be easily done using the small arrows that are on the edges
of the clip. Grab one with the mouse and drag them to the preferred position. To
control what picture will be the cut the video view will display the video-frame
at that position.
</p>

<h2>Managing Projects</h2>

<p>
The Open Movie Editor uses a simple &quot;project management&quot; facility. To
name a project you just need to type in the name in the textbook on the left. A
new project can be started with the appropriate command in the &quot;Project&quot; menu.
All your project will be added to the project list on the right of the menu bar.
Just select the one you want to work on, and it's loaded. In case you want to
duplicate a project, go to &quot;Save as...&quot; in the &quot;Project&quot; menu, you will then be
asked to enter a new name for the copy.
</p>


<h2>Cross fades</h2>

<p>If you want to create a cross fade, where two clips blend into each other
softly, you just drag them onto the same track such that they overlap. Than red
cross on blue background will appear like in the highlighted region in the
image.</p>

<h2>Audio Automations</h2>

<p>Audio automations are useful, if you want to make some parts of an audio more
quiet than other parts, or if you want to fade out some background music. Just
click on the automations tool button as marked in the image, and click onto an
audio clip to add automation points. You can drag them around with the mouse,
and if you drag on outside of the clip, it will disappear. Press shift while
adjusting to manipulate the volume for a whole area.</p>

<h2>Splitting</h2>

<p>To split a clip into two parts, use the split tool as highlighted in the
image. If you click on a clip, it will be divided at that position.</p>

<h2>Titles</h2>

<p>If you want to add a transparent text overlay, a so called title, you have to
prepare a transparent png image in your favorite image manipulation program.
Then you can add it to the timeline by dragging it onto a track.</p>


<h2>Mute for Original Sound</h2>

<img src="images/openme_9.png" width="300" height="271" alt="Screenshot" />

<p>The original sound of a clip can be easily muted, be clicking the right mouse
button on it. This will pop up a context menu, where you can select "Mute
Original Sound". A muted clip will be indicated by a simple mute symbol.</p>


<h2>Add Tracks</h2>

<img src="images/openme_10.png" width="300" height="271" alt="Screenshot" />

<p>Using the &quot;Tracks&quot; menu, new audio- and video-tracks can be easily
added to the timeline.</p>

<h2>Remove Tracks</h2>

<img src="images/openme_11.png" width="300" height="271" alt="Screenshot" />

<p>Tracks might also be removed again, by clicking on the &quot;Video&quot; or
&quot;Audio&quot; buttons in front of every track. This brings up a menu where
you can choose &quot;Remove Track&quot;.</p>

<h2>Snapping</h2>

<img src="images/openme_12.png" width="300" height="271" alt="Screenshot" />

<p>
Whenever a clip is positioned on the timeline it will snap to the other clips
that are near the current position. This behavior can be disabled by the tiny
button that is marked in the picture on the right.

</p>

<h2>Undo / Redo</h2>

<img src="images/openme_13.png" width="300" height="271" alt="Screenshot" />

<p>Every action in the Open Movie Editor can be easily undone, using the
&quot;Undo&quot; and &quot;Redo&quot; commands from the &quot;Edit&quot; menu.
Alternatively there are keyboard shortcuts available: Ctrl+z and Ctrl+y</p>

<h2>Effects / Video Filters</h2>

<img src="images/openme_14.png" width="300" height="271" alt="Screenshot" />

<p>
Applying one or more video filters or effects onto a video clip is easy, just
select a single clip by pressing the Ctrl key while clicking the desired
clip with the mouse. The clip will then have a <span style="color: red;">red</span>
outline. Then you can use the "Add Effect" selector from the "Effects" tab to
find a effect and add it to the clip. You can add any number of effects, and use
the "Edit Effect" button to vary the parameters. For some effects this button is
not available, that means that this specfic effect has no variables.
</p>

<h2>Exporting to video files</h2>

<p>
Creating a new video file from the arrangement is called &quot;Rendering&quot;, it's also
available in the &quot;Project&quot; menu. You have to select a filename, video
and audio codecs, and there you go. The choices are limited at the moment, and
there will probably some simpler presets in the future.
